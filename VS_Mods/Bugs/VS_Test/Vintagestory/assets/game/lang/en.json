This is particularly valuable in hot climates or during summer, as food spoils quicker in the heat, and for long winters when less food is available. There are several food preservation methods, combining them can have a multiplicative effect.<br><br><strong>Cellars</strong><br>Any fully enclosed space is considered a cellar and will have a low and consistent year-round temperature. The most simple cellar consists of a 1x2x1 hole with a container in it, that's covered up with soil. More elaborate versions can be up to 7x7x7 blocks in size with a door. To verify a cellar is working, look at any container's block info. You will want to reach the lowest possible food perish speed. Build cellar walls from soil, brick or stone materials.<br><br><strong>Crocks</strong><br>You can place <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-mealcooking\">meals</a> inside <a href=\"handbook://block-crock-raw-east\">crocks</a> to receive a slight benefit, additionally you can seal crocks with <a href=\"handbook://item-beeswax\">wax</a> or <a href=\"handbook://item-fat\">fat</a> to reduce the decay rate 10-fold.

When you come across them, enclose them in a fenced-in area or chase them to your desired location. They are also attracted to troughs filled with food. Use a <a href=\"handbook://block-trough-genericwood-small-ns\">small trough</a> (filled with grain) for chickens and a <a href=\"handbook://block-trough-genericwood-large-head-north\">large trough</a> (filled with grain or dry grass or vegetables) for boars and sheep.

The eggs must be incubated for several days to hatch.  Place a <a href=\"handbook://block-henbox-empty\">Henbox</a> to provide your chickens with a place to lay eggs and sit on them.  Also requires a rooster to fertilize them eggs!  If there are not enough henboxes, chickens will lay eggs on the ground which will not hatch.<br><br><strong>Domestication</strong><br>Animals bred this way, will, over several generations, lose their fear and aggressiveness towards the player. After the 3rd generation you can also instantly kill them with a <a href=\"handbook://item-cleaver-copper\">cleaver</a>.<br><br><strong>Beekeeping</strong><br>In order to obtain wax and honey, you will need to build <a href=\"handbook://block-skep-empty-east\">skeps</a> into which wild bees like to swarm. Be sure to place some flowers around. You can move a populated skep inside a free backpack slot by right clicking it. Carry it to the desired location and use CTRL+Scroll wheel to select that backpack slot, to place the skep back down again. Your bees will visit nearby flowers and slowly produce honey, a richly populated skep can also in turn swarm to start a new bee colony in a nearby empty skep. When your skep colony is mature, break it to remove the <a href=\"handbook://item-honeycomb\">honeycomb</a>, note that this is quite likely to anger the bees. Angry bees can become diverted if there happens to be anything nearby which <a href=\"handbook://item-strawdummy\">looks similar</a>.

Keep both the material and the plumb and square in your hotbar, then right click on a block with the plumb and square in your hands to reinforce. Left click again to remove the reinforcement.\n\nMainly intended as a low level of protection in  multiplayer games, though in single player games you could use it to prevent accidental breakage by yourself.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the reinforcement system see <a href=\"https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php?title=Block_reinforcement\">this wiki page</a>",

    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece1": "Never go into the caves. Never go under the ground. Haven't you heard the story of Blind Bat Rickhart? He was a young boy, just like you lot. Curious, rambunctious, and ready for adventure. Some say he was born in one of the villages around here.\r\n\r\nWell there wasn't much to do in the fields for a boy like that. He couldn't be bothered with tilling the soil or gathering wheat. One year, as it came to be harvest season, he decided to slip away while everyone else was working. He knew his father would be furious, but Rickhart was a greedy boy and he wanted his adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of traipsing through the heath and forest, young Rickhart had had a great deal of fun, and now the wrath of his father was clear in his mind. He was terrified of going home, so he decided he would stay out for the night and give his father time to calm down and worry about him.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't very bright, but he wasn't very stupid either. He at least knew better than to be caught roaming about at night. By the time the sun was almost gone, he had stumbled upon a deep, well-hidden cave and decided he would pass the night there. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece2": "Well, the sun went down, and he had himself a nice fire built just near the mouth of the cave. He was safe and hidden there, but the rocky floor was uncomfortable and Rickhart was bored of sitting around. So he decided to play a little game with himself. He would walk into the cave's darkness and see which gave out first: his courage or the cave.\r\n\r\nSo he started walking deeper into the cave, brushing off all the warnings his parents and elders had given him since he was born. They had always told him that there were dark things under the earth. Darker even than the monsters we see at night. Rickhart was scared, for sure, but that was all the more thrilling for him. He felt himself just getting into the real adventure as he took one step and then another, deeper and deeper. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece3": "His heart beat like a drum on festival night, but he kept going. He was giggling now, thinking how much fun he was having. He was sure it was all just a silly jaunt, but the images of torn flesh, long hairy limbs, and scraping metal started to fill his head. He could hear his grandmother's ragged voice as he remembered all the old stories she'd told him about the Drifters and horrible Groundlings.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of giving up and running, he bumped headfirst into the cave wall. He'd made it to the end. He breathed a sigh of relief, did a small jig to celebrate his victory, and turned to walk back to his warm fire— only, when he took his first step back the ground gave out beneath him. He fell and fell through the earth, scraping and tearing his skin all the way down. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece4": "When he finally came to stop and got a chance to right himself, he was far below the little cave where he had started. Now young, foolish Rickhart had only one thing in mind: he wanted to get home as quickly as he could. That being said, he couldn't see anything in the immense darkness, and he was so disoriented from the fall that he wasn't quite sure which way he'd came from. All he could tell was that he had landed in a large cavern, and that he could only figure out by the echoing sounds of the rocks sliding after him. ___NEWPAGE___",

The rock was smooth to the touch. He followed it for a couple feet and realized it formed an entire wall of smooth, even rock. There was some kind of wall here, carved into the earth.\r\n\r\nHaving no other option, Rickhart held his hand to the wall and used it as a guide, walking alongside it, but it led him deeper into the cavern. He followed it for a while, until it suddenly fell away and Rickhart lost his balance, stumbling to the ground. He stood up, and decided to not risk venturing further. He held onto the wall again and tried to walk back to the place where he thought he'd fallen through the dirt.\r\n\r\nOnly, after walking a good distance, he found himself somehow further into the cavern, judging by the sound of his footsteps. In his confusion, he reached out into the open darkness beyond the wall... And felt his hands touching another strange, carved stone wall. He realized suddenly that this was some kind of maze, full of walls in the same shape and design; he must have latched onto the wrong wall after falling onto the ground. ___NEWPAGE___",

These unknown 'things' watching him. Waiting for him. He hears movement. A skittering echoes through the cavern. It's getting closer.\r\n\r\nPanicking, Rickhart turned and ran through the maze, stumbling from wall to wall, moving as fast as he could to get away from the skittering.

He was frozen, trying desperately to disappear and somehow wake up in the warm wheat fields and smell his mother's cooking, but instead all he could smell was something like eggs left cracked and burning in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe thing stopped moving. Stopped making noises. Just stood there, like a statue. Gathering his wits about him for a moment, Rickhart realized perhaps it hadn't actually noticed him.

They took him home and did what they could to take care of him, but he was never the same after that. His vision never came back. He would still have shaking fits from time to time. It took his family years to finally get him to tell them what happened. They told the rest of the village about it, and the story spread from there.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would tell the story to curious travelers and young children. There was one thing he always said. One thing he always finished his story with. 'Do you remember the giant metal thing I mentioned?' he would say, leaning in close. He'd whisper, 'The thing that shined a light on me? Well, the truth is, it wasn't a light at all. No, not at all. It was an eye, you know. It saw me. Stared into me. I can feel it staring at me all the time. Except when I tell this story.

    "lore-reflection-piece4": "It was at this point, some years later, that a change occurred. Although he never deigned to speak of it, I believe Jonas had some kind of breakthrough. His inventions grew equally more wondrous and monstrous. The golem, the locusts, the things without which our endeavor would fail: these he created and shared freely with the world. The people, both common and titled, began to see him as a shining light here to guide them to a new era. In truth, perhaps that would have come to pass were it not for the great adversity we were soon confronted with.\r\n\r\nSoon, the country would begin to understand its own fragility. Each day there were new reports. Refugees wandering from town to town. It felt as though we had all been sentenced to death. That helplessness returns to me still, when I close my eyes. When the emperor sent out the call for assembly, Jonas was among those compelled to find a solution.\r\n\r\nI was there when he was told the news. I remember finding it strange when for a moment his face ran pale and he seemed to shake with fright. But there was nothing strange about that, I see now. He locked himself in his laboratory and bade me not to disturb him. For months he continued this way, leaving only to eat and drink. His youthful looks quickly deteriorated and it seemed as though a great weight bore down on him. He emerged in time for the Diet, with a heavy, unwieldy pile of schematics. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-reflection-piece5": "The rest, I have lost the will to speak of. I only wish to say that my friend, my brother, has done the best he could, and that I am not without hope. Our time down in these dark caverns has not drained me of life; it has convinced me of it. I have seen my dream of a better world come true in these depths. I have seen noble and commoner work, sing, weep, and die side by side. I have seen horrors, but I have seen humanity face them with hard eyes and clenched fists. I have struggled alongside the fiercest stars of our ruined land: scholars, engineers, soldiers, hunters, merchants, even beggars. All who found the strength to resist our doom. My countrymen.\r\n\r\nOur greatest endeavour will come to life in a matter of minutes. I go now to meet my comrades and see the result of this: our last, finest gambit. May our work be not in vain.",

    "lore-return-piece1": "I woke up in the dark. Everything dark. Everything painful. Every breathe in agony.\r\n\r\nWaiting changed nothing. I started crawling. I couldn't keep track of how long. Weeks, months maybe. All the tunnels had changed. Not that I could remember the way up anymore.\r\n\r\nI'd feel my way forward, finding dead end after dead end. Digging with my hands when I could. Hearing other things down there with me. \r\n\r\nEventually I found my way out. Everything changed. Green again. Brown and red and blue again. Life returned. \r\n\r\nI could finally look at myself. Everything still hurt. I was broken. Flesh half gone. Joints missing. No leg. I can't remember what happened after the black sick reached my head. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-return-piece2": "It took me many years to regain my focus. Around me, humanity started to adapt and flourish again. \r\n\r\nUnaware of their danger. I have set myself to work these past centuries. Though I am no scholar, no alchemist, my mind is strong. I have deciphered and learned much of what Jonas and the others already knew. \r\n\r\nI intend to use that knowledge shortly to turn the tide. Perhaps that is why I now reminisce on those dark, painful years after the awakening. May this endeavor be more gentle for you, my friends.",

    "lore-themorning-piece1": "Gather round, gather round!\r\n\r\nThis is a story to get you through the long, cold night when it comes for you, like it has this night for us. \r\nDo you think we were the first to feel the cold? The first to see the ghosts wandering through the night? \r\nNo! This has been happening since my grandfather's era. Since the time before that! \r\nI'll tell you about when it began. When Bearfirth, the first of us, saw the protector light go dim and realized she was not alone in the forests...\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a time before this one, when the world was dark. There was nothing out there. No light. No trees. No birds and no music. What horror! A great miasma of nothingness. Can you imagine such a place? Through this emptiness a woman crawled. Alone. Starving. Lost. She only knew suffering. Only knew pain and grief. But she continued living, because she did not know of any other path.",
    "lore-themorning-piece2": "One day she dreamt of great storms, trembling earth, turning wheels, and she woke to a new world. One of vibrance. Of light! Beautiful light! And beautiful green! Here now were the birds and beasts. The fruit and grains. The winding rivers and the great horn mountains. Where before there was nothing now there was wonder all around. She was the first to walk our world. Our home.\r\nThus she came to know joy. But when the sun left the sky and the night fell over the new land, she heard the whispers, the groans, the crunching footsteps of those abominable shades that haunt us still. She then came to know fear, and a dreadful fear it was! She fled into the dirt and the quiet places. Deeper down she went, hounded by the foul voices, until she came upon something hidden and strange. There in the dark she found herself in the presence of a god. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-themorning-piece3": "And so the First Trade was conducted. The god granted her a madness. The madness to keep struggling in the face of fear. In exchange, she swore fealty to it. She swore to never forget what the god taught her. \r\nThen she climbed. She returned to the surface, and in her madness she fought the monsters that harrowed her. \r\nFor twelve years she fought! Every day she would rest and enjoy the bountiful wonders of this world, and every night she would rise and battle the creatures that came to hunt her.\r\nShe felled hundreds of them, yet they always returned. As time passed by, she grew wise.\r\nClimbing to the high mountaintops, she called out- Called out! In a clear voice that rang through the dales, she called, \r\n'I am Bearfirth! I am mighty! If you hear my voice, come find me! Come look for me in the plains, in the forests, by the rivers! Find me, and you too will be mighty!'\r\n\r\nAnd her voice was heard. Other men and women appeared. Those who had been hiding in the dirt and the roots. In the gray shadows. They heard her voice and were entranced. They followed it to the source and came together as a crowd before her. They were fearful and hungry. \r\n___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-themorning-piece4": "Now comes the Second Trade. She offered them wisdom in exchange for strength. The people, desperate for guidance, agreed to the deal.\r\nWorking together, Bearfirth and her companions built the first home. These walls were made from only mud and stone, but the ghosts had not the power to overcome them when the sun left the sky. The people rejoiced when they saw this, but Bearfirth, upon realizing she would not have to battle anything that night, felt the years and years of exhaustion, once held back through willpower, now fall upon her as a flood. Collapsing to the ground, she knew that her life was at its end. \r\nThe people gathered around her, fearful and lost again at the thought of her leave-taking. They think they will have to return to the dirt and roots if she is gone. They think she pulls the morning into the sky. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-themorning-piece5": "Seeing this, she makes the Third Trade, the Final Trade!\r\nShe asks of them, \r\n'Survive this night. Stay watchful, do not give up yet. Do this for me and my strength will be yours.'\r\nHer people are hesitant, but they bind themselves to the trade. They keep watch. The shades scream and roar at them -  Can you hear them? They're still out there, screaming at us now!\r\nBut her people do not run. They have an oath to fulfill. They build the walls stronger and trust that Bearfirth will hold up her end of the bargain. When the sun finally returns, it finds them proud and cheering. At last they know the madness that Bearfirth knew: They learned that by fighting in the face of hopelessness they could accomplish anything.\r\nWith their newfound strength, they worked together and made a grand village. They spread to distant lands, making villages and helping those in hiding there. And always, they remembered that long night and the sunrise that came afterwards.",

This structure is used to slowly enrich iron with carbon (carburization).<br><br><strong>Construction</strong><br>Building a cementation furnace requires around 65 blocks of refractory bricks, which come in 3 different qualities: <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybricks-good-tier1\">tier 1</a>, <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybricks-good-tier2\">tier 2</a> and <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybricks-good-tier3\">tier 3</a>. Each tier is more robust against heat damage than the last. You will also need 6 <a href=\"handbook://block-refractorybrickgrating-tier1\">refractory brick gratings</a> and an <a href=\"handbook://block-irondoor-north-down-closed-left\">iron door</a>. Build two <a href=\"handbook://block-stonecoffinsection-granite-north\">stone coffin sections</a> and <a href=\"handbook://block-stonecoffinlid-granite\">two stone coffin lids</a> from either granite or andesite. Place a 3x2 flooring of grating. In the middle of it, place both stone coffin sections in opposing directions, so as to create a large container. With a sneak + right click on the stone coffin you will see an outline showing where you have to place the remaining refractory bricks and the iron door. You can add additional refractory bricks on the outside of the structure, if you wish, but keep the air pathways in the interior of the structure clear.<br><br><strong>Firing</strong><br>Once that is ready, fill the stone coffin to the top with 16 iron ingots and charcoal or coke. Then, dig out an empty space two blocks below each stone coffin section - this is where you have to place 2 piles of coal (or charcoal) in order to fire the furnace. You can use a chisel to build a small retaining wall so that the coal doesn't fall to the sides while piling. Once all is ready, ignite the coal piles.<br><br>You can verify the furnace is working by looking into it through the door (but we don't recommend you go inside there, it's quite hot!) Fire particles should emanate from the burning coal and smoke should exit from the chimney. You will need to replenish and re-light the coal piles approximately once a day, but leave the stone coffin closed. Firing will take about one week in total, after which you can break the stone coffin to get <a href=\"handbook://item-ingot-blistersteel\">blister steel</a>.<br><br><strong>Refining</strong><br>Blister steel needs to be worked on an iron anvil to create steel. You can create an iron anvil by smithing the bottom and top halfs on a bronze anvil. Place the parts on the ground on top of each other with some flux in between, then hammer a few times to create the iron anvil.",
